NDIM (int): 2 or 3 depending if the model is bidimensional or tridimensional

RESTART_ITER (int): Restart iteration

TIME_TRESHOLD (int): Time iteration after which fluid and structure are coupled in an unsteady simulation

NB_FSI_ITER (int): Number of max internal iterations to couple fluid and structure

RBF_RADIUS (float): Radius for the RBF interpolation. It is dimensional (i.e. in meters) and must be set so that at least 5 structural points are always inside a sphere with that radius and centered in any of the structural nodes. The more nodes are included, the better the interpolation. However, with a larger radius, the interpolation matrix becames less sparse and the solution more computationally expensive

AITKEN_PARAM (float): Under relaxation parameter, between 0 and 1

UNST_TIMESTEP (float): Physical time step size in unsteady simulations, must match the one in the other cfg files

UNST_TIME (float): Physical simulation time for unsteady problems

FSI_TOLERANCE (float): Tolerance for inner loop convergence between fluid and structure. This is the maximum average structural displacements, between two inner iterations, that can be accepted

CFD_CONFIG_FILE_NAME (string): Path to the fluid cfg file

CSD_SOLVER (string): Structural solver to be used. As of now, only the native modal solver is used, activated with the keyword NATIVE. However, other solvers can easily be added

IMPOSED_MOTION (string): YES or NO. Specifies wether the structural solver will integrate the structural equations or just impose a specific movement. In the latter case, forces are not mapped onto the structure, as it would not be required.

MAPPING_MODES (string): YES or NO. Special feature that can only be used with the native solver. Used to extract the mapped modes onto the aerodynamic mesh.

CSD_CONFIG_FILE_NAME (string): Path to the solid cfg file

RESTART_SOL (string): YES or NO

MATCHING_MESH (string): YES or NO, the fluid and structural mesh match at the interface

MESH_INTERP_METHOD (string): Interpolation method in case of nonmatching meshes. TPS or RBF

DISP_PRED (string): Displacement predictor order FIRST_ORDER or SECOND_ORDER. To be used in unsteady simulations

AITKEN_RELAX (string): DYNAMIC or STATIC

TIME_MARCHING (string): YES or NO
